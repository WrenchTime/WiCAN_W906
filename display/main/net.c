/*
 * The network task: it drives the WiFi driver by what app->link orders and asks the adapter what app->poll
 * hands out. It decides nothing. Written without the board and without a build: every call was read in the
 * sources of ESP-IDF v5.5.2 and of espressif/mdns 1.13.1. What only the board can decide is marked CHECK.
 *
 * It also creates the task of the second source, the Cerbo GX (gx.c), in the first round that finds that
 * source switched on: gx_step().
 *
 * One task does both, so nothing here needs a lock of its own. What the task waits on, wherever it waits:
 *   net_task()       an event of the driver, at most NET_STEP_MS; the link and the poll have times of their
 *                    own and are asked again then
 *   poll_step()      the main task, until what the events named is stored (platform_stored(); app.h)
 *   ask()            the adapter, at most POLL_TIMEOUT_MS for the whole request
 *   find()           the first answer to the mDNS query, at most NET_FIND_MS
 *   station_stop()   the driver's report that the station has left, at most NET_STOP_WAIT_MS
 *   leave()          NET_LEAVE_WAIT_MS, so that the answer of the web server is out before the network is
 *
 * Two of these limits are not this task's to keep. ask(): the HTTP client knows a time for each of its
 * steps, not for a request, and on_http() shortens it step by step - but while the headers of the answer
 * are read no step ends as long as bytes arrive (esp_http_client_fetch_headers() reads on until the headers
 * are complete, whatever its parser made of them), and the client does not look at what on_http() returns.
 * An adapter, or something else at its address, that never finishes its headers holds the task. find(): the
 * mDNS component ends the query by a timer of its own task, and mdns_query_ptr() waits for that task
 * without a limit. So the task counts its turns, and the main task restarts the display when the count
 * stands still (net_turns(), main.c).
 *
 * The events of the driver arrive in the task of the event loop. They are passed on as bits and not as a
 * queue of messages: bits cannot run over while this task waits for the adapter, and what an event says is
 * read from the driver when the bit is looked at.
