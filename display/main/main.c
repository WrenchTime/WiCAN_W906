 * The start of the display, and the task that carries out what the app asks for (platform.h).
 *
 * Written without the board and without a compiler for it: every call was read in the sources of ESP-IDF
 * v5.5.2. What only the board can decide is marked CHECK.
 *
 * The start, in this order, and what happens when a step fails. "Gives up" means: the reason is logged, and
 * after GIVE_UP_MS the display restarts and tries again. A firmware that runs for the first time after an
 * update (update_pending) gives up on EVERY failed step: it has not passed, and the restart is what makes
 * the boot loader take the update back.
 *   1 the boot loader    which slot runs, whether it waits to be confirmed, whether the last update was taken
 *                        back. Asked first: the steps below need to know whether an update is pending.
 *   2 store_init()       fails: the display goes on with what is built in. Every read then finds nothing,
 *                        every write fails and says so; the access point gets a new password with every start.
 *   3 the access point   its password, made once. Before the board, because the random numbers need the ADC
 *                        that the temperature sensor of the board takes afterwards (see ap_password_make()).
 *   4 board_init()       fails (the port expander does not answer): no panel, no knob. Gives up.
 *   5 the knob           held through KNOB_HELD_READINGS readings: safe mode. A reading that fails is not held.
 *   6 guard_start()      with the reason of the reset and the counter in the RTC memory
 *   7 the rooms          app_t, the tokens, the jobs: once, from the external RAM. Fails: gives up.
 *   8 what is stored     read into the room of a job (kept_t), which nothing uses before the tasks run
 *   9 app_init()         cannot fail: what it cannot read counts as not stored
 *  10 board_panel_start(), screen_start()
 *                        fail: no picture. Gives up. From here on the screen task runs the app.
 *  11 net_start()        fails: the display runs without a network and says "no WiFi"; the web server is not
 *                        started on top of a network that did not come up.
 *  12 web_start()        fails: the display runs without its web interface.
 * The app comes before the panel because the screen task needs it from its first round on; nothing is to be
 * seen before that anyway, the backlight is dark until the screen task switches it on.

 * The internal memory malloc() hands out: what heap_malloc, heap_malloc_min and heap_block of GET /api/info

 * more: the 32 KB of CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_RESERVE_INTERNAL are a heap of their own (or several, if no one
 * piece was free for them) with the capabilities DMA, INTERNAL, 8BIT and 32BIT (esp_psram.c,
 * esp_psram_extram_reserve_dma_pool()) - without MALLOC_CAP_DEFAULT. malloc() asks for exactly the two bits
 * below (heap_caps.c, heap_caps_malloc_default(), for everything up to CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL)
 * and a heap counts when it has every bit that is asked for (heap_caps_match()): malloc(), and with it lwIP,
 * gets nothing of that pool, however much of it is free. The external RAM, which has DEFAULT, is left out by
 * INTERNAL. (A malloc() that finds no internal memory does not fail: it is served from the external RAM.)
 *
 * What the three calls cost (heap_caps.c, multi_heap.c and multi_heap_platform.h of ESP-IDF v5.5.2; the walk
 * itself in tlsf.c of espressif/tlsf, read on its master):
 * - heap_caps_get_free_size() and heap_caps_get_minimum_free_size() add up one number per heap and take no
 *   lock. The minimum is the sum of the lowest stand of each heap; they need not have been at their lowest
 *   at the same moment, so it can be lower than the free memory ever was.
 * - heap_caps_get_largest_free_block() walks every block of every heap that counts, used ones and free ones,
 *   and holds the lock of that heap for the whole walk. That lock is a critical section
 *   (portENTER_CRITICAL_SAFE()): the interrupts of this core are off, and the other core spins if it wants
 *   to allocate or free there. This core is the one of the panel (PANEL_CORE): its interrupts wait as long,
 *   and one that is held up for longer than a bounce buffer lasts, 0.86 ms, is lost (board.c says what the
 *   picture does then). Reckoned, not measured: 0.1 to 0.2 us a block, some hundred to a thousand blocks, so
 *   0.05 to 0.2 ms once a second, the walk of the largest heap in one piece.
 * So the walk is made once a second and no more often, by this task, and never under platform_lock(): the
 * screen task takes that lock for every reading of the knob.
 * CHECK: the picture stands still. A picture that jumps by a band of lines once a second is this walk: then
 * it is made less often, or by a task on the other core.
 * The numbers are read one after the other, not at one moment.
