/*
 * The HTTP server of the display: it reads a request, asks web_route() what it is and calls the function of
 * app_web.h for it. It decides nothing, and it calls nothing of the app but app_web.h and platform_events(),
 * and reads app->uploading. Written without the board and without a build: every call was read in the
 * sources of ESP-IDF v5.5.2. What only the board can decide is marked CHECK.
 *
 * Every request goes through web_route(), whatever its method and path: one handler is registered for the
 * path "*" (httpd_uri_match_wildcard) and the method HTTP_ANY, and the server looks for no other match, so
 * it never comes to its own 404 or 405 (httpd_uri.c) - once the handler is registered: web_start() names
 * the moment before that. What does not become a request at all - a method the parser does not know, a
 * line or headers too long, a client that falls silent - would be answered by the server with a text of its
 * own: on_error() is registered for all of that and closes the connection without an answer. No header is
 * ever set here but status, type and length, and with the page four more: the two that forbid to show it in
 * a frame, Vary, and Content-Encoding where the page is sent compressed (handle()). Of the headers of a
 * request the first line of each name is read (the server hands out no other). Nothing a client sent is
 * logged but the length of a firmware.
 *
 * One request at a time: the server has a single task, which runs the handler of one request to its end
 * before it looks at the next connection (httpd_main.c), and nothing in this file runs in another task
 * after web_start(). The buffers below are used by that task alone. This is also what makes a firmware
 * upload the only one: while it runs, no other request is even read.
 *
 * And it is why every wait for a client has an end of its own here. The server gives each single read its
 * receive timeout (5 s) and knows no time for a body: a client that sends a byte every few seconds would
 * hold the one task, and with it the web interface, for as long as it likes. A body has WEB_BODY_MS, a
 * firmware as long as the app lets the upload run (APP_UPLOAD_IDLE_MS without a block), and what is dropped
 * behind an answer WEB_DROP_MS.
