/*
 * The platform: what connects the logic in components/core (app.h, app_web.h) to the device - tasks, the
 * WiFi driver, HTTP in both directions, the flash, the screen. It decides nothing: it passes on what
 * happened and carries out what the app asks for. Everything that can be decided is in the core, where it
 * is tested on the host. This layer is run on a PC as well, each file against stand-ins for ESP-IDF, LVGL and
 * the board (display/host/platform): that shows what its files do with what was read of those, and nothing
 * of what the board does - nothing here was tested on it.
 *
 * Five tasks and the HTTP server of ESP-IDF:
 *   screen   (screen.c)  reads knob, switch and touch every 20 ms, ticks the app five times a second,
 *                        hands the scene to LVGL, sets the backlight
 *   lvgl     (screen.c)  draws. It and the screen task are the two that touch LVGL, under a lock of their
 *                        own in screen.c
 *   network  (net.c)     drives the WiFi by app->link and talks to the adapter by app->poll
 *   httpd    (web.c)     the web interface of the display: web_route() and app_web.h, the page, the upload
 *   main     (main.c)    starts everything, and carries out the events of the app
 *   gx       (gx.c)      talks to the broker of the Cerbo GX by app->cerbo, over its one socket. Only on a
 *                        display that was given the address of a Cerbo, and never in safe mode (gx_start())
 *
 * One lock (app.h): platform_lock() around every call into the app and every read of it. Nothing that
 * blocks happens under the lock - no HTTP request, no scan, no write to the flash, no drawing.
 *
 * Events: whoever called into the app calls platform_events() BEFORE it gives the lock back. That takes
 * the events of the app and copies what they name (settings, networks, layout text, ...) into a queue of
 * the main task, which writes to the flash and restarts - in the order the events came, storing first.
 * So an event always stores what was in the app when it was raised. The web server and the network task
 * do not go on to their next request before all of it is carried out: platform_stored().

 * switched on (cerbo_on(), read under the lock): a display without the address of a Cerbo never has the
 * task, and neither has one in safe mode, whatever is stored - the safe mode is there to get out of what a
 * stored setting does, and with this one would come a task, a socket and a reader of what others send.
 * Once created the task stays, also when the address is taken away again: the core gives it no order then.

 * again. ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE once the task exists: there is never a second one.
 *
 * What the task may do: it calls into the core under platform_lock() only - cerbo_next(), cerbo_host(),
 * cerbo_out() and the reports cerbo_opened(), cerbo_bytes(), cerbo_down() on platform_app->cerbo, each
 * report with a time read before the lock was waited for - and makes no call of its socket under the lock.
 * It never waits for platform_stored() and does not call platform_events(): the second source raises no
 * event and stores nothing.
