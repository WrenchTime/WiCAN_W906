"""Shows that the host tests of the display logic really guard the rules they claim to guard.

A test that stays green when the rule is removed proves nothing. Every mutation removes or weakens
one rule in a source of display/components/core; the test named with it must then FAIL in at least
one check. The run is red when

  - an unchanged test does not pass,
  - a mutation no longer applies (the text is not found exactly once) or does not compile,
  - a mutation leaves the test green,
  - a mutated test aborts or hangs without a failed check (a crash names no rule).

The mutations live in mutations/<module>.py, one list MUTATIONS per file with entries
(name, test, file, text in the source, replacement); file is relative to display/, test is the
name of the test program, for example "test_fmt".
Rules for mutations: they must not change a type and must not rely on a compiler warning - gcc
(CI) and clang (Mac) differ there.

  python3 redproof.py                  all mutations
