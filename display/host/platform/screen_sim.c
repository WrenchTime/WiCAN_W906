/*
 * Runs display/main/screen.c on a PC: the file is included as it is, and its two tasks run against the real
 * core and a device made of stand-ins - a knob, a glass, a backlight, LVGL, the panel, FreeRTOS. "make" in
 * this directory builds and runs it; redproof.py breaks screen.c in one place at a time (mutations/screen.py)
 * and expects a check to fail.
 *
 * One thread, and no clock of the PC: a run is the same on every machine. What stands for the device, and
 * what it rests on (ESP-IDF v5.5.2 and LVGL 9.5.0, read, not run):
 *   FreeRTOS        the scheduler is the simulation. The screen task has the higher priority: it runs
 *                   whenever it is due, and everything else happens while it sleeps in xTaskDelayUntil().
 *                   That function is the one of tasks.c, with the wrap of the tick count; a tick is 10 ms.
 *                   A wake can be made to come late.
 *   the screen task is entered once for a start and left for good at one of its waits when the time of the
 *                   scenario is over: what it knows it keeps in the variables of its function. So a scenario
 *                   says beforehand what the world does and when (`world`), lets the display run, and then
 *                   looks at what each round did (`rounds`) - and every round is looked at when it ends
 *                   (round_over()), in every scenario.
 *   the drawing task
 *                   runs its first round when it is created (it is above the task of main.c, which creates
 *                   it) and then whenever its sleep is over or the screen task has woken it, while that one
 *                   sleeps. Its function is entered for each round and left at its wait: it keeps nothing
 *                   in its variables. What stands before its loop therefore runs once on the device and
 *                   with every round here - the stand-in of the watchdog knows that. A round takes no time.
 *                   A frame that takes long is not drawn by that function: for a span of time the scenario
 *                   names, the lock of LVGL simply belongs to the drawing task, as it does while
 *                   lv_timer_handler() draws.
 *   the two locks   each knows who holds it. Taking one twice, giving back one that is not held, a call of
 *                   LVGL or of the drawing code without the lock of LVGL, a call into the app without the
 *                   lock of the app, a reading of the board or a call of LVGL under the lock of the app, a
 *                   task that sleeps with a lock: failed checks. The lock of LVGL is asked for with a
 *                   time: if the drawing task holds it, that time passes. The lock of the app can be held
 *                   by another task for a while: that time passes as well.
 *   the clock       stands still while a task works, and moves where one waits or is held up
 *   LVGL            lv_timer_handler() asks its clock, flushes two areas through the callback of screen.c
 *                   when something was given to it since the last frame, and returns what the scenario
 *                   says. Everything else is a counted call.
 *   the drawing code (components/ui)
 *                   ui.h is the real header, so that screen.c is built against what it promises; ui_show()
 *                   and ui_row_at() are stand-ins that remember what they were given
 *   the board       a switch that is pressed for spans of time, counts of the encoder that arrive at a
 *                   time, fingers that move over the glass, readings that fail, a backlight that remembers
 *                   what it was set to
 *   the app         the real one. app_button() and the other six calls of the screen task go through
 *                   wrappers that note what screen.c hands over; app_scene() is called a second time when
 *                   a round is over, to compare with what LVGL was given
 *
 * What this cannot see, in short: nothing of ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS or LVGL runs, so every "the scheduler does"
 * above is the model. No task is ever interrupted in the middle of a function, except by the frame described
 * above; there is one core. How long anything takes on the board - app_scene(), ui_show(), a transfer on the
 * I2C bus, an erase of the flash - is not known here: a scenario can say that something takes long, not
 * whether it does. Stacks, the real drawing code and the picture are not here at all.
