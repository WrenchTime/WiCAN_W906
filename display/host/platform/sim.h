/*
 * What the simulations of the platform share (main_sim.c, net_sim.c, web_sim.c, screen_sim.c): the checks and
 * the log.
 *
 * A simulation is one program. It includes one file of display/main unchanged, as a unit of its own, and runs
 * it against the real core (display/components/core) and against stand-ins for everything below: the headers
 * in idf/ say what ESP-IDF declares, the simulation says what it does. It prints a line "FAIL ..." for every
 * check that failed and "<n> checks, <m> failed" at its end, and returns 0 only if none failed. redproof.py
 * relies on exactly that: a mutation of the platform file has to end in a line FAIL, not in a crash.
 *
 * So a rule a stand-in watches is a CHECK as well, not an assert(): the lock that must not be held where the
 * platform waits, a call the driver would refuse. Such a check is counted every time it is looked at. Where
 * the stand-in could not go on behind a broken rule, it says so with a FAIL and carries on in a way that is
 * safe for the PC. NEED() is for the simulation itself (a file it cannot open): that is nobody's rule, and it
 * ends the program with status 2.
 *
 * A header with code, for one program each.
