"""Stand-in for the WiCAN display on a PC: the web interface of display/API.md without the board.

The page of the display (display/main/web/index.html) can be tried against it in a browser, and
test_page.py holds it against the examples of display/API.md.

  python3 mock_display.py                    http://127.0.0.1:8907
  python3 mock_display.py --port 8907
  python3 mock_display.py --upload-rate 64   a firmware arrives with 64 KiB a second (0: at once)

  http://127.0.0.1:8907/        the page, read from its file with every request, and compressed for
                                every client that says it reads gzip, as the display sends it
  http://127.0.0.1:8907/mock    the same page under a strip with what one does at the device:
                                release on and off, press the knob, press it long (refuse), and the
                                situations around it. The page itself knows nothing of /mock.
                                The strip has no button for a touch on the screen: no question of
                                the display is answered by one (nav.h).

The mock listens on 127.0.0.1 and nowhere else: it has no login, like the display, and it is no
display. Open it by that address, not as "localhost": the display answers only to an IPv4 address
or to wican-display.local in the Host header, and so does the mock.

In a test:

  display = mock_display.Display(clock=mock_display.SimulatedClock())
  status, kind, body, more = display.handle("GET", "/api/info", {"host": "192.168.1.77"}, lambda count: b"")
  display.lasting(False); display.release(True); display.clock.advance(601)      no real waiting
  server = mock_display.Server(display).start(); ...; server.close()

Taken from the sources, read and written a second time here:
  - which request is what and what is refused before a handler runs (components/core/web_route.c),
    in that order; what each request does and answers (app_web.c), with the order locked, busy,
    asking, hot, the rest; the bodies (web_json.c, catalog.c, settings.c), byte for byte
  - the page in its two forms (main/web.c, accepts_gzip() and handle()): compressed by page_gz.py,
    as the build of the firmware compresses it, for a client whose Accept-Encoding names gzip, and
    as it is for every other; Vary with both. The bytes are those of the device only where its
    build has the same zlib as the Python that runs the mock. accepts_gzip() here was held against
    the one of web.c once, on 2026-10-10, by a program that is not part of the repository: 320005
    lists made at random, the same answer to each. Nothing repeats that when either side changes
  - the release and the question to the knob (access.c): 10 minutes after the last accepted change,
    30 minutes at most, 60 seconds for the knob, a press in the first 1.5 seconds does not count,
    known are the last ticket and the one before it
  - the release for good (access.c, settings.c, app.c, app_web.c): the setting "web_open", on by
    default as on the device - the mock starts with its web interface released, and so it does after
    every restart and after a factory reset. It has no end, a change neither renews nor shortens it,
    /api/info tells it with "lasting" and 0 seconds left, and the switch of the ten minutes does
    nothing while it lasts. lasting() is the row "Dauerhaft frei" of the display; POST /api/settings
    cannot turn it: a web_open that is another value than the one in use is answered 400
  - the check of a layout (layout.c): the same checks in the same order with the same paths and
    texts, so that the first problem named is the one the display would name
  - the check of the first bytes of a firmware (ota_check.c), the settings (settings.c), the WiFi
    requests (web_json.c) and how a network is stored (net_select.c, app.c)
  - the catalogue of the W906 (tools/w906/fixtures/car_config_w906.json), its values with the
    ignition on (autopid_data_ignition_on.json), fault memory lists (dtc_result_*.json) and the
    built-in views (display/layouts/w906_default.json)
  - the second source, the Cerbo GX (cerbo.c, settings.c, web_json.c, app_web.c): the setting
    "cerbo" - empty or an IPv4 address in dotted form, written only while it is set -, the object
    "cerbo" in /api/info and the member "cerbo" and the values with GX_ in /api/values, each only
    while an address is set, the values fresh under 5 s and left out from 60 s on. With an address
    the prefix GX_ is the Cerbo's: a value of the adapter that bears it is left out of /api/values,
    so that no key stands twice; and "values" of /api/info counts what /api/values names of the
    Cerbo - not a number without end, which has no text there. While it has an address the views the
    display chose itself end with the five built-in pages of the Cerbo (display/layouts/gx_default.json),
    as one text under the name "W906 OM651 Standard + Cerbo"; views that are stored or looked at stay
    as they are; and no key that begins with GX_ is ever "unknown". A mock nobody gave an address
    answers byte for byte what it answered before there was a second source

What the check of a layout does not check as the display does:
  - a text that is not UTF-8. The display reads bytes and passes them on; the mock answers
    "not valid JSON" (the same holds for the bodies of the WiFi requests and the settings: 400)
Everything else of it is the rule book of layout.c a second time. test_page.py holds it against the
hand-written reports in display/test/fixtures. Against the C code itself the mock was held once, on
2026-10-05, by a program that is not part of the repository: the same random requests (layouts,
settings and networks damaged at random, the release, the knob and the clock in between) to the mock
and to components/core, answers compared byte for byte, no difference. Nothing repeats that when
either side changes: the refusal "hot" and "busy" for storing and forgetting a network while the
display reads or clears came later on both sides and were never compared that way.

Invented, because nothing fixes it. The page must not rely on any of this:
  - every number of /api/info, the networks in range, the network the display is in. Three names
    are chosen to show at once if the page ever puts what it received into its HTML: two networks
    in range and a value the adapter delivers outside its profile
  - the values: those of the fixture, of which a few move with the time, and two that are not in
    the profile (a binary one, and the one with the name above)
  - a restart takes 4 seconds, in which no request is answered (the connection is closed)
  - "busy" is a switch of the strip: it stands for a read or a clear at the display and for the
    clear dialog. The device tells the two apart where a network is stored or forgotten: that is
    refused while the read or the clear itself is under way, not while the dialog only shows. The
    mock refuses it whenever the switch is on
  - "zu heiß" is a switch of the strip as well: the heat keeps the backlight off (heat "off" in
    /api/info, with a temperature of 88 degrees) until "abgekühlt". The device measures its chip
    and switches the light off from 85 degrees on, back on below 80 (guard.h)
  - the display stays in its network when another one is stored or forgotten, and it joins a
    network that was stored if it is in none and that network is in range. The device leaves its
    network with every change of the list and looks anew (link.h)
  - after a factory reset the mock goes on answering at its address; the device is then only
    reachable through its own access point
  - the Cerbo: one listens at CERBO_ADDRESS and nowhere else, and it "sends" (a bundle with every
    request, so every value is fresh), is "silent" (its broker answers, its flow publishes nothing)
    or "unreachable" - set_cerbo(), and three buttons of the strip. What the display then shows
    of it follows the times of cerbo.h in a simple form: live for 10 s behind the last bundle,
    then quiet, silent from 20 s on (the device says so with the first answer of the broker behind
    those 20 s, up to 10 s later); without a session connecting for 15 s, then unreachable. Its
    values and counters are invented, the lag is always 0, and nothing is ever refused

Not modelled:
  - views made from the catalogue (layout_from_catalog): the built-in views always suit the
    catalogue of the mock, POST /api/layout/reset always answers them
  - the safe mode, the heat that only dims the backlight, the stored layout "one step back"
  - of the Cerbo: the views "off" (safe mode), "no_wifi" and "newer", the wait between two
    attempts to reach the broker, a bundle that arrives late, values a bundle does not name
  - a firmware image is not verified beyond its first 112 bytes; every upload that arrives whole
    counts as good
  - the display ends an upload that brings nothing for 30 seconds from its own clock (app_tick);
    the mock ends it when its socket has been silent for that long
  - every answer ends its connection, the HTTP server of the device keeps connections
  - the two headers with which the device forbids to show its page in a frame: the strip /mock
    shows it in one. And every answer of the mock says "Cache-Control: no-store", none of the device
  - a Content-Length that is no number is answered 411 here; the HTTP server of ESP-IDF refuses
    such a request by itself. A method the Python server does not know gets its 501
