/*
 * The hardware of the Elecrow CrowPanel 2.1 inch HMI ESP32 Rotary Display (ESP32-S3R8, 16 MB flash, 8 MB
 * octal PSRAM, round 480x480 IPS panel with ST7701S, capacitive touch, rotary knob with press switch).
 *
 * Everything in this component is READ from the schematic of the maker (Main V1.0) and from the maker's
 * examples. Nothing was measured: the board was not there when this was written. Places that can only be
 * decided with the board in hand are marked CHECK in board.c. What was seen on the board since stands
 * where it belongs, with its date - so far the encoder alone (board_encoder()).
 *
 * Wiring (schematic):
 *   I2C            SDA 38, SCL 39; touch controller at 0x15, port expander PCF8574 at 0x21
 *   expander       P0 touch reset, P2 touch interrupt (input), P3 LCD power, P4 LCD reset,
 *                  P5 switch of the knob (input, pressed = low); P1, P6, P7 unused.
 *                  The interrupt output of the expander is not connected: switch and touch are polled.
 *   panel init     3-wire SPI, 9 bit: CS 16, SCK 2, SDA 1
 *   panel data     RGB565 parallel: DE 40, VSYNC 7, HSYNC 15, PCLK 41,
 *                  blue 5, 45, 48, 47, 21; green 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9; red 46, 3, 8, 18, 17
 *                  (the names of the schematic; which colour of a pixel is sent on which: board_pins.h)
 *   backlight      GPIO 6, PWM, high = on
 *   encoder        A 42, B 4, pull-ups on the board, no debounce capacitors
 *   console        native USB (USB serial JTAG); GPIO 43 (UART0 TX) drives a LED of the board
