 * ESPHome examples sends the same bytes after a software reset; Lesson02 and 03 leave the three C0h to C2h
 * of page 0 out, Lesson05 has two bytes more in E2h.
 *
 * Not in this table: 36h (order of red and blue) and 3Ah (pixel format). The driver sends both by itself
 * ahead of the table, from BOARD_PANEL_ELE_ORDER and BOARD_PANEL_COLMOD_BITS, and warns about a table that
 * sends them again. The software reset is sent by esp_lcd_panel_reset().
 *
 * CHECK: red, green and blue areas show in their colour. What leaves the chip is what the firmware of the
 * maker sends: 36h = 08h (BGR), and the red of a pixel on the lines the schematic calls blue (that
 * firmware exchanges red and blue of every pixel in software before it sends it; here the pins are named
 * in that order instead, BOARD_PANEL_DATA_PINS). The ESPHome lessons of the maker have both the other way
 * round, red on the lines called red and 36h = 00h (written by ESPHome after the sequence, with command
 * set 2 selected). That is the same picture only if the ST7701S obeys the bit BGR while it is fed through
 * the RGB bus, and no source says that it does; the first of those lessons carries the note "colors are
 * off". If red and blue are exchanged: BOARD_PANEL_ELE_ORDER to LCD_RGB_ELEMENT_ORDER_RGB. If that
 * changes nothing, the panel does not obey the bit: put it back, and exchange the two groups of five in
 * BOARD_PANEL_DATA_PINS.
 * CHECK: grey steps are even and nothing is washed out or inverted. If not, this is not the sequence of
 * the panel that is built in: compare with the other st7701_type*_init_operations of Arduino_GFX.

 * The RGB panel on top of the command bus. Nothing of it is left behind when it fails.

 * The frame buffer lies in the PSRAM. The DMA does not read it there: an interrupt copies it, a few lines
 * at a time, into one of two bounce buffers in the internal RAM, and the DMA sends those. This is the mode
 * the maker's firmware and ESPHome drive this board in; the timing is the one of the maker's firmware
 * (board_pins.h). No event callback is registered, neither here nor in main/screen.c: they are free for
 * whoever wants to draw in step with the picture (esp_lcd_rgb_panel_register_event_callbacks() sets all
 * of them at once).
 *
 * The two interrupts of the panel run on the core of the task that calls this. Espressif advises to run
 * the LVGL task on the same core, so that two cores do not share the PSRAM while a line is copied.
 *
 * Which of the two bounce buffers is to be filled next, the driver knows by counting the interrupts of
 * the DMA. When some of them are lost - they were held up for longer than one buffer lasts, 0.86 ms with
 * this timing: the flash is written, interrupts are off for long - the count no longer fits the picture.
 * It is set right in the vertical blanking, together with a restart of the DMA at the first buffer:
 * ESP-IDF v5.5.2 does that when it has counted too few interrupts in a frame, and when it was asked to
 * (esp_lcd_rgb_panel_restart(); panel_restart_start() below asks all the time). With
 * CONFIG_LCD_RGB_RESTART_IN_VSYNC it restarts the DMA in every blanking but never sets the count right
 * (esp_lcd_panel_rgb.c, lcd_rgb_panel_try_restart_transmission(); ESP-IDF issue 19070, mended on master
 * only). After one lost interrupt every buffer is then filled while it is sent, and the picture stays
 * shifted. So that option is off, and this file does not compile with it.
 *
 * CHECK: the picture stands still, straight and whole, also with WiFi connected and traffic on it. A
 * picture that is sheared, shifted sideways or torn into bands is the timing or the bandwidth of the
 * PSRAM. Then try the set of the maker's ESPHome lessons: BOARD_PANEL_PCLK_HZ 18000000,
 * BOARD_PANEL_PCLK_ACTIVE_NEG 1, HSYNC front porch 20, pulse 10, back porch 10, VSYNC 8, 10, 10,
 * BOARD_PANEL_BOUNCE_LINES 10 - and with it what those lessons set: CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS,
 * CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA.
 * CHECK: single pixels that sparkle, or edges with a coloured fringe: the panel takes the data on the
 * other edge of the pixel clock, flip BOARD_PANEL_PCLK_ACTIVE_NEG.
 * CHECK: the picture is upright and not mirrored. If it is not: esp_lcd_panel_mirror() or
 * esp_lcd_panel_swap_xy() on the panel at the end of this function (the RGB driver then turns every block
 * while it copies it into the frame buffer; the ST7701 driver passes the call on), and the same turn for
 * the coordinates in board_touch(). The rotation of the LVGL display does not turn the pixels.
 * CHECK: while the flash is written (a layout or the settings stored, a firmware update) the picture may
 * stop or show garbage, because the PSRAM cannot be read then. It has to be whole again within a moment,
 * every time: store a layout twenty times, upload a firmware, start the WiFi. A picture that stays
 * shifted up or down by BOARD_PANEL_BOUNCE_LINES lines, flickering at the left edge of every such band,
 * is the count described above: see whether the timer of panel_restart_start() runs. The cross-check, to
 * be seen once: with CONFIG_LCD_RGB_RESTART_IN_VSYNC=y and its #error taken out the shift should stay
 * after some of these writes (expected from the code of the driver, never seen here).
 * CHECK: moving content does not tear. If it does, BOARD_PANEL_FRAME_BUFFERS 2 changes nothing by itself:
 * main/screen.c would have to let LVGL draw straight into the two frame buffers
 * (esp_lcd_rgb_panel_get_frame_buffer()) and hand the finished one to esp_lcd_panel_draw_bitmap(), which
 * then shows it from the next frame on instead of copying.
 * CHECK: heap_caps_get_minimum_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL) after an hour with WiFi, the web page and
 * an upload. The two bounce buffers take 38.4 KB of the internal RAM, twice what the design counted
 * with. If it gets tight: the set of the ESPHome lessons above has buffers of half the size.

/*
 * The twenty lines to the panel are driven with the weakest drive the pins have. They toggle at up to
 * 12 MHz a few centimetres from the antenna, and with the default drive the receiver of the board hears
 * them: the radio link failed at about -69 dBm, where a healthy ESP32-S3 has 20 dB to spare.
 *
 * Measured on the board in the vehicle on 2026-10-10 with a firmware that alternated the drive every two
 * minutes, 70 minutes, pings from a PC five a second, the same signal strength in both (-65 dBm at the
 * median): with the default drive (GPIO_DRIVE_CAP_2) 284 of 1830 pings were lost (15.5 %), with the
 * weakest (GPIO_DRIVE_CAP_0) 62 of 1780 (3.5 %); of 16 neighbouring pairs of two minutes the weakest lost
 * fewer in 15. The picture was the same in both, by eye.
 * CHECK: the picture stays clean on every screen, also with the housing warm: the weakest drive makes the
 * slowest edges. If single pixels flicker or colours tear, try GPIO_DRIVE_CAP_1 for the pixel clock alone
 * first (it is the line the panel takes the others by).

 * sleep. This one is taken not to, from two things in the sources: the firmware of the maker asks for the
 * number of fingers whenever LVGL wants the pointer, and its driver (Adafruit_CST8XX) returns what is in
 * its buffer without looking whether the transfer worked, which after a missing answer would be the

 * is on the screen, the controller does sleep: then the caller has to take false as "no finger", and a

 * CHECK: a finger at the top edge reads y near 0, at the bottom edge near 479, left x near 0, right near
 * 479, and a touch lands where the picture is. The firmware of the maker takes BOARD_TOUCH_Y_OFFSET (20)
