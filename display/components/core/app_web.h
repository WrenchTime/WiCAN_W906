/*
 * The web interface of the display on top of app.h: what each request does and answers (display/API.md).
 * The HTTP server of the platform reads the request, asks web_route() what it is - with
 * app_web_request() filling in what the display knows - and, if it is not refused there, calls the
 * function for the route. The platform holds the lock of app.h around every call.
 *
 * Every function returns the HTTP status and writes the body: JSON, zero terminated, *length bytes. `out`
 * has to have APP_WEB_OUT_SIZE bytes. An answer that does not fit is 500 {"error":"too_large"}.
 * Refusals have the body of web_error_body(). A `body` that is NULL is an empty one. A function that is
 * called with a route it does not serve answers 404 "not_found" and changes nothing.
 *
 * Time as in app.h: a time before the latest the app has seen counts as that one. Every function that can
 * change something takes its time over into app->clock_ms, also when it refuses; app_web_request(),
 * app_web_get() and the check of a layout change nothing, not even that (the check reads the layout into the
 * room app->checked, which is nobody's between two calls).
 *
 * Changes: a route that changes something calls access_write() first and answers 403 "locked" without it
 * (the release may have ended since web_route() looked). The release is renewed by that call, also when the
 * request is refused afterwards for another reason. A route that needs the knob asks access_may_ask()
 * instead and answers 403 "locked" or 409 "asking" by what it says, else access_ask() and 202 with
 * web_asked_json(). Where several refusals apply, the order is: 403 "locked", then 409 "busy", then 409
 * "asking", then 409 "hot", then the rest. While a firmware upload runs no question is asked (409 "busy"):
 * the screen shows the upload and takes no input, a question would wait unseen. While the heat keeps the
 * backlight off (app.h: the level is GUARD_HEAT_OFF) no question is asked and no upload begins (409 "hot"):
 * nobody could see the question, and one that waited when the light went off was refused by
 * app_temperature(). A question that is asked is confirmed by the knob alone, never by a tap (nav.h).
 * A new question replaces what an earlier one left behind (the network asked for, ask_detail) at once, also
 * when it has no detail of its own.
 *
 * While a fault memory request of the display is under way - the flow is READ_SENT, READING, CLEAR_SENT or
 * CLEARING: sent or accepted, and not ended - nothing takes the adapter away from under it: every request
 * that would restart the display or make it leave its network is answered 409 "busy". That is the restart,
 * the factory reset and the upload (app_busy(), which also holds while the clear dialog shows and an upload
 * runs), and storing and forgetting a network. The settings at the knob offer no restart, previous version
 * or factory reset in the same phases (nav.h): a read would be left without its list, a clear without its
 * outcome.
 * A request that is refused leaves everything as it was, but for the release and the time named above - and
 * but for a running upload, which app_web_upload_end() ends whatever it answers.
 *
 * The events these functions raise name what is in the app at the moment they are carried out
 * (APP_EVENT_STORE_LAYOUT stores app->layout_text as it is then): the platform takes them and what they
 * name with app_take_events() before it gives the lock back, and stores before the next request is served.
 * APP_EVENT_STORE_LAYOUT and APP_EVENT_ERASE_LAYOUT never wait to be taken together (app.h): a SAVE takes a
 * reset back that still waits, a RESET a save - the later of the two alone counts. Every other event that
 * waits stays.
 *
 * The page itself (WEB_ROUTE_PAGE) is an embedded file of the platform, not of this module. The platform
 * never sends an Access-Control-Allow header: the protection by WEB_HEADER_NAME rests on that.
