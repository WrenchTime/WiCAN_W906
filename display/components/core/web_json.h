/*
 * The bodies of the web interface of the display (display/API.md): what it answers and what it reads.
 * Examples, compared byte for byte by the test: display/test/fixtures/web_*.json.
 *
 * For every writer: the text has no whitespace and the members come in the order given here. In texts,
 * " and \ are written with a backslash, bytes below 0x20 and the byte 0x7F as \u00xx (hexadecimal digits
 * in small letters); everything else is passed on, also bytes that are no UTF-8. A text pointer that is
 * NULL counts as an empty text. The return value is the length without the terminating zero, or -1 if the
 * text does not fit: out is then an empty string, with size 0 nothing is written (out may then be NULL),
 * and no byte from out[size] on is ever touched.
 *
 * No answer ever contains a WiFi password: of a stored password web_wifi_json() tells nothing but whether
 * there is one and whether it is the one of the documentation. (Where an SSID or a host holds the same text
 * as a password, that text is in the answer - as the SSID or the host.)
