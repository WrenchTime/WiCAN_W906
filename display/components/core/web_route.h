/*
 * The web interface of the display: which request is what, and which is refused before any handler runs.
 * Pure logic; the HTTP server only passes on what it received. The interface is described in
 * display/API.md.
 *
 *   GET  /                          the page
 *   GET  /api/info                  version, memory, network, adapter, release
 *   GET  /api/catalog               the values the adapter can deliver, and the keys the Cerbo GX delivered
 *   GET  /api/values                the current values (from the memory of the display, the adapter is not asked)
 *   GET  /api/layout                the views in use, as the layout text
 *   GET  /api/layout/gx             the built-in pages of the second source, the Cerbo GX, as a layout text
 *   PUT  /api/layout?mode=check     checks a layout, changes nothing
 *   PUT  /api/layout?mode=apply     shows it on the display without storing it
 *   PUT  /api/layout?mode=save      stores it
 *   POST /api/layout/reset          back to the built-in views
 *   GET  /api/dtc/last              the last fault memory list and the one before the last clear
 *   GET  /api/wifi                  stored and visible networks, never a password
 *   POST /api/wifi                  store a network                       (knob)
 *   POST /api/wifi/forget           remove a stored network
 *   POST /api/settings              brightness, direction of the knob, ...
 *   POST /api/reboot
 *   POST /api/reset                 factory reset                         (knob)
 *   POST /api/ota                   firmware upload                       (knob, after the upload)
 *   GET  /api/ticket?id=N           what became of a question to the knob
 *
 * The web interface can neither read nor clear the fault memory of the vehicle.

//                       no upper case, nothing behind them.
//   405 "method"        the path is known, but not with this method
//   403 "host"          the Host header is missing or neither an IPv4 address nor the name of the display,
//                       see web_host_allowed(). Protects every route, also the reading ones, against a web
//                       page whose name was bent to the address of the display (DNS rebinding). Path and
//                       method are judged before it: such a page can learn which paths exist, nothing more.
//   403 "header"        not a GET and the header is missing or not exactly "1". A web page of another origin
//                       cannot send this header: the browser asks first (preflight), and that is never answered.
//                       The preflight is an OPTIONS request, WEB_OTHER here: 405. The argument holds only
//                       while no answer of the display carries an Access-Control-Allow header.
//   403 "locked"        the route changes something and the release is closed
//   400 "query"         the query string is longer than WEB_QUERY_MAX; PUT /api/layout without exactly one
//                       mode of check, apply, save; GET /api/ticket without exactly one id of 1 to 10
//                       digits that is 1 to 2^32-1 (zeros in front are digits like the others: id=01 is
//                       ticket 1); any other route with a query string that is not empty.
//                       "Exactly one" means: the query string is that one pair and nothing else.
//   411 "length"        not a GET and no Content-Length
//   413 "too_large"     Content-Length above the limit of the route: WEB_BODY_LAYOUT_MAX for PUT /api/layout,
//                       slot_size for the firmware, WEB_BODY_SMALL_MAX for every other route that is not a
//                       GET, also for POST /api/layout/reset. An empty firmware (length 0) is refused as
//                       well. A GET has no limit: its Content-Length is not looked at.
//   409 "busy"          firmware upload, reboot or factory reset while `busy`
// PUT /api/layout?mode=check changes nothing: it needs the header but not the release. Every other route
// that is not a GET changes something, also the reboot, and so does PUT /api/layout with a query that is
// not exactly "mode=check": while the release is closed it is answered 403 "locked", not 400 "query".
