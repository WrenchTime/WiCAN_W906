/*
 * Who may change something on the display through its web interface.
 *
 * Reading is open to everybody in the same WiFi. A change needs a release, and there are two of them.
 *
 * The timed release is given at the device (menu "Web-Zugriff", row "Freigabe"): somebody has to sit in
 * front of the display. It ends ACCESS_OPEN_MS after it was given or after the last accepted change,
 * whichever is later, when it is switched off at the device, and with a restart (this struct is never
 * stored). It never lasts longer than ACCESS_OPEN_MAX_MS from the moment it was switched on at the device,
 * whatever was changed since: a device in the WiFi that writes again and again does not keep it open,
 * somebody has to come back to the display.
 *
 * The lasting release (access_open_lasting()) has no end. The owner asked for it on 2026-10-10: he had to
 * walk to the display for every change. The caller gives it at the start while the setting says so, which
 * it does by default (settings.h: web_open; app.h), so that everybody in the WiFi may change what the
 * release alone allows. Neither ACCESS_OPEN_MS nor ACCESS_OPEN_MAX_MS apply to it, a change neither
 * shortens nor renews it, and it ends with access_close() alone - and with a restart, behind which the
 * caller gives it again or not.
 *
 * Three changes need more than a release, whichever of the two it is, because they can lock the owner out
 * or replace the firmware: new WiFi data, installing firmware, and the factory reset. The browser asks, the
 * display shows what is asked, and only a press of the knob within ACCESS_CONFIRM_MS carries it out. A
 * press in the first ACCESS_ASK_SHOWN_MS does not count: it was meant for the screen the question appeared
 * over. The browser gets a ticket number and asks what became of it. So a device in the WiFi cannot take
 * the display from its owner under a release that lasts either.
 *
 * Time is milliseconds since boot. A time before one passed earlier counts as no time passed. Nothing lasts
 * beyond the largest time, 2^64-1: what would end later ends there. The lasting release is what has no end
 * at all, so none that could lie there: it holds at the largest time as at every other one. A question
 * asked under it ends there like every question.
