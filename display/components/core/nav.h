/*
 * Which screen the display shows and what the knob does there. Pure logic: the user interface draws what
 * this struct says, passes every input on and carries out what comes back.
 *
 * The grammar of the knob, the same everywhere, usable without looking:
 *   turn         on the value pages: one detent = one page, hard ends, no wrap
 *                on the brightness screen: one detent = NAV_BRIGHTNESS_STEP percent, clockwise is brighter
 *                everywhere else: moves the focus over the rows of the screen, hard ends
 *   short press  on the value pages: opens the menu; everywhere else: acts on the focused row
 *   long press   one level back; on a value page: back to the first page - or, where the caller knows one
 *                (nav_world_t.home), to the first page that shows values
 * The value pages are passive: no page in the rotation of the knob has an action.
 * Touch is an addition: a swipe on a value page is a turn of one detent, a tap on a row is focus plus
 * short press. Everything works with the knob alone. In the two dialogs (NAV_DTC_CONFIRM, NAV_CONFIRM) the
 * knob alone moves the focus and confirms: a touch only cancels there. What lies over a screen is answered
 * with the knob alone as well: a touch does nothing there.
 * So no question on the screen is confirmed by a touch, on whatever row and at whatever time: not the clear
 * of the fault memory, not restart, previous firmware and factory reset of the settings, not what the
 * browser asks for (WiFi data, the uploaded firmware, the factory reset), and not "Update in Ordnung?".
 *
 * Screens and their rows (the focus starts on the row marked *):
 *   NAV_PAGES        the value pages; `page` is the one shown, -1 if the layout has none to show
 *   NAV_MENU         *0 Fehlerspeicher, 1 Helligkeit, 2 Nachtmodus, 3 Web-Zugriff, 4 Info, 5 Einstellungen,
 *                    6 Zurück
 *   NAV_DTC          *0 Lesen, 1 Liste ansehen, 2 Liste vor dem Löschen, 3 Zurück
 *   NAV_DTC_BUSY     no rows: progress of the own request
 *   NAV_DTC_LIST     *0 .. lines-1 the lines of the list, then Erneut lesen, Fehler löschen, Zurück
 *   NAV_DTC_CONFIRM  *0 Abbrechen, 1 Löschen
 *   NAV_DTC_CLEARED  *0 .. lines-1 the lines of the outcome, then Fertig
 *   NAV_DTC_FAILED   no rows: the reason; a short press acknowledges
 *   NAV_DTC_OLD      *0 .. lines-1 the lines of the list before the last clear, then Zurück
 *   NAV_BRIGHTNESS   no rows: turning changes the brightness
 *   NAV_WEB          *0 Dauerhaft frei ja/nein, 1 Freigabe an/aus, 2 Zurück
 *   NAV_INFO         *0 .. lines-1 lines to scroll, no action
 *   NAV_SETTINGS     *0 Drehrichtung, 1 Hotspot, 2 Neustart, 3 Vorherige Version, 4 Werkseinstellungen,
 *                    5 Zurück
 *   NAV_CONFIRM      *0 Abbrechen, 1 Ausführen - for Neustart, Vorherige Version, Werkseinstellungen
 *
 * Something can lie over every screen and takes every input (nav_overlay):
 *   NAV_OVER_UPLOAD  a firmware upload runs: every input is ignored
 *   NAV_OVER_ASK     the browser asks for something that needs the knob (access.h): a short press
 *                    confirms, a long press refuses; turning, swiping and a tap do nothing
 *   NAV_OVER_UPDATE  the firmware started for the first time after an update and asks "Update in
 *                    Ordnung?": a short press says yes; everything else is ignored, a tap as well (a
 *                    firmware whose knob does not work must not be kept because its touch does)
 * In this order if several apply.
 *
 * The direction of a turn. The detents of nav_turn() are those knob_turn() reports (knob.h): positive is the
 * next page and the next row, negative the page before and the row above. Which way the hand turns for that
 * is the business of the knob and of its setting `reverse`, which turns the sign - a preference for pages and
 * rows, and they take the sign as it comes. On this board, with `reverse` off, clockwise (seen from the
 * front) is NEGATIVE: seen on the device on 2026-10-10, the focus of the menu went up.
 * The brightness is the one place that does not follow the setting. The arc on its screen grows clockwise,
 * and the hand follows what it sees: clockwise is brighter, whatever `reverse` says. So nav takes back
 * there what the knob did with the sign, and for that the world carries the setting (nav_world_t.reverse):
 * the detents the hand turned clockwise are -n, and n if `reverse` is set.

 *   - the focus lies beyond the last row (a list became shorter): it goes to the last row
 *   - no input for NAV_IDLE_MS on a screen other than NAV_PAGES, NAV_DTC_BUSY and NAV_DTC_CONFIRM, and no
 *     overlay: -> NAV_PAGES; from NAV_BRIGHTNESS with NAV_DO_SETTINGS_STORE. The own request and its outcome
 *     are kept.
 * Only the last rule waits for an overlay to go, the others follow what happened below it as well. A screen
 * entered here has the focus on row 0, NAV_DTC_LIST entered from NAV_DTC_CONFIRM on Fehler löschen.
 * A time before the one of an earlier call counts as no time passed.
 * The end of the own request is no input to this module by itself: the outcome of a request that ends later
 * than NAV_IDLE_MS behind the last input is shown by one tick and left for the value pages by the next. The
 * caller sees to that (app.h): it passes the end as an input that acts on nothing - nav_swipe() without a
 * direction - before the tick that follows the flow, and the outcome stays for NAV_IDLE_MS unless somebody acts.
