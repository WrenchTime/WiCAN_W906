/*
 * The display as a whole: every module of this directory wired together, still without hardware. The
 * platform below it (on the device: tasks, WiFi, HTTP, flash; on a PC: sockets and a script) only passes
 * on what happened and carries out what is asked. So the behaviour of the device can be played on a PC
 * against tools/w906/mock_wican.py (display/host).
 *
 * One lock: the platform holds it around every call of this module and around every direct call to
 * app->link, app->poll and app->cerbo. Requests to the adapter are sent WITHOUT the lock, and so is every
 * byte to and from the broker of the Cerbo.
 *
 * Who calls what:
 *   the task that owns the screen   app_button() and app_encoder() every 20 ms, app_tap(), app_swipe(),
 *                                   app_tick() about five times a second, app_scene(), app_backlight()
 *   the task that talks to the      link_next() and the link_* reports on app->link, poll_prepare() and
 *   network                         poll_apply() on app->poll, and app_net() after every report to the link,
 *                                   after every poll_prepare() that handed out a request and after every
 *                                   poll_apply() - before the lock is given back. A request is only sent
 *                                   while app_host() is not empty. poll_prepare() is called with every turn
 *                                   of the task, also without a network: it is what lets the time pass for a
 *                                   read of the fault memory that waits for the adapter (poll.h).
 *   the task that talks to the      cerbo_next() and the cerbo_* reports on app->cerbo (cerbo.h), and
 *   broker of the Cerbo GX          nothing else of the app: see "The second source" below
 *   both                            app_take_events()
 *   the web server                  app_web.h
 *
 * Time is milliseconds since the start. Each task reads it before it waits for the lock, so a call may come
 * with a time before that of the call before it: such a time counts as no time passed (clock_ms).

 * second source 5456; 232656 bytes calculated for a 32 bit target that aligns 64 bit numbers to 8 bytes,
 * not measured on the device): static storage or the external RAM, never a stack.
 * - settings: settings_defaults(), then the stored text if settings_from_json() takes it
 * - the second source: cerbo_init() with the address of the settings, safe_mode and ap_ssid; in no network
 * - profiles, bound id, catalogue and old list as stored (poll_init(), poll_stored()); link_init() with the
 *   profiles and safe_mode; knob with settings.reverse; hold, access and nav in their start states
 * - the built-in layout is parsed (has_builtin false if that fails or there is none: then the views are
 *   made from the catalogue, layout_from_catalog(), whenever the built-in ones would be used)
 * - the layout in use: the stored text if there is one, safe_mode is false and layout_parse() takes it
 *   (source STORED); else the choice below. In safe mode the stored text is not even read: it may be what
 *   crashed the display. The app keeps no second copy of what is stored: a preview ends with a restart, a
 *   save or a reset (app_web.h), and the page in the browser keeps the text it loaded if it wants to go back.
 * - update_pending: the question "Update in Ordnung?" is shown; without an answer for
 *   APP_UPDATE_CONFIRM_MS the display restarts (APP_EVENT_REBOOT), and the boot loader takes the update back
 * - the lines of the stored old list and the info lines are there from the start; no event is raised
 *
 * The choice of the layout while the source is not STORED and not PREVIEW, made at the start and whenever
 * the check sum of the catalogue changed (app_net()): the built-in layout if layout_suits() it, else
 * layout_from_catalog(). layout_text follows the layout in use. When the choice changes the source the value
 * pages start at the first page of the new layout; when it does not, the page shown stays (nav_tick() finds
 * the nearest if it is not shown any more). A layout the browser sends keeps the page shown where it has one
 * at that position (app_web.h).

/*
 * The second source: the Cerbo GX (cerbo.h), whose broker a task of the platform talks to. It is switched
 * on by the setting `cerbo` (settings.h: the address of the broker) and is off in safe mode whatever is
 * stored; cerbo_on(&app->cerbo) tells. A display without that address is the display it was before there
 * was a second source: no order ever comes from cerbo_next(), and nothing the app shows, answers or stores
 * differs by a byte.
 *
 * What the platform does with it, each call under the lock and with a time read before the lock:
 * - cerbo_next(&app->cerbo, now) in every round of its task, and what it orders carried out WITHOUT the
 *   lock: for CERBO_DO_OPEN the address (cerbo_host()), for CERBO_DO_SEND the bytes (cerbo_out()) are copied
 *   before the lock is given back
 * - the reports cerbo_opened(), cerbo_bytes() - with a room of CERBO_TOKENS tokens of its own, not the one
 *   of the app - and cerbo_down()
 * - no app_net() behind any of it, and no app_take_events(): the source raises no event and stores nothing
 *
 * What the app does with it:
 * - app_init(): see there. app_net(): cerbo_network() when link_in_network() changed - the source needs the
 *   network, not the adapter, which may sleep while the display stays in the network of the router
 * - app_web.h, POST /api/settings: cerbo_set_host() when the address the settings hold became another one
 *   So cerbo_host(&app->cerbo) is settings.cerbo at every moment, and app->cerbo.network link_in_network()
 *   behind every app_net().
 * - the two info lines below, GET /api/info and GET /api/values (app_web.h) - while an address is set
 *
 * What the app does NOT take from it - the values of the Cerbo lie in a store of their own (cerbo.values),
 * and no function of the fault memory is ever handed that store:
 * - the fault memory: what may be read and cleared (dtc_flow_read_block(), dtc_flow_clear_block()), the
 *   flow, the hold and the clear dialog see the adapter and its values (app->poll) alone
 * - the poll and the link: no request to the adapter depends on the Cerbo, and no scan or join
 * - the standby rule: values of the Cerbo are no reason to keep the light on - they are always there, and a
 *   display on permanent power would never go dark. "showing" (app_backlight()) asks the adapter alone
 * - app_busy(), the release of the web interface (access.h), nav and the idle times: a bundle is no input
 * - the screens: no page shows a value of the Cerbo yet
 */

/*
 * A dark screen. Nobody acts on a screen he cannot see: an input - a press, a detent, a tap, a swipe - that
 * is made while the backlight is off (app_backlight() gives 0) is not passed on to nav.
 * - Off by the standby rule: that input wakes the screen, by restarting the idle time. A question of the
 *   browser, an upload and an unconfirmed update count as something to show: the screen lights up for them.
 * - Off by the heat (the level of guard_heat() is GUARD_HEAT_OFF): nothing wakes it, and no input is
 *   passed on for as long as it lasts. A question nobody can see is none: when the heat switches the light
 *   off, the question of the browser that waits is refused, and the clear dialog and the dialog of the
 *   settings are left, and a press that is under way is dropped (app_temperature()); while it lasts
 *   app_web.h asks no question and begins no upload.
 *   Only "Update in Ordnung?" stays: it has no answer that takes it back, it cannot be confirmed in the
 *   dark, and its time runs on.
 * A press is made with the reading with which the switch begins to count as pressed (knob.h); what the
 * knob reports of a press that began on a dark screen, short or long, is dropped. The idle time restarts
 * with every press, detent, tap and swipe, on a dark screen and on a lit one.
 *
 * The end of a fault memory request of the display counts as an input for the two idle times - the one of
 * nav.h, after which every screen but the value pages is left (NAV_IDLE_MS), and the one of the standby rule -
 * and for nothing else. A read that waited through a pause of the connection (dtc_flow.h) can end minutes
 * after the last hand was at the display: without this its list, or its failure after DTC_FLOW_WAIT_MS of
 * silence, stood on the screen for one tick before the value pages came back, and behind such a failure
 * the screen went dark at once. Who reads and waits is to see what became of it.
 * - A request ends when the flow leaves the phases in which one is under way (READ_SENT, READING, CLEAR_SENT,
 *   CLEARING), whatever it ends as: a read with its list (LIST) or as failed (FAILED), a clear with its outcome
 *   (CLEARED), as failed (FAILED) or as unknown (UNKNOWN). A request that is withdrawn before it was sent and a
 *   clear that did not arrive (IDLE, LIST; dtc_flow.h) end as well: the progress gives way to the menu or the
 *   list there, too. Only the own flow is looked at: a scan somebody else started - the adapter scanning for a
 *   phone or for Node-RED - ends without any of this, whatever the state of the adapter shows.
 * - app_tick() is where the app learns of it, the one place: the first tick behind the end, before nav_tick()
 *   follows the flow, and with the time of that tick. Nothing tells the app earlier: a read that is given up
 *   for the silence of its adapter ends in poll_prepare(), and a poll_prepare() that hands out no request is
 *   followed by no app_net(). A request the tick finds under way is one whose end it will note, whoever asked
 *   for it; one that began behind the last tick is noted where it is asked for (app_do()), so its end is seen
 *   however soon it comes. (A second request that begins behind an end no tick has seen yet takes the place of
 *   the first: that end is not noted, and the input that asked again is younger than it.)
 * - nav is told of an input that acts on nothing (nav.h: a swipe without a direction): its idle time starts
 *   anew. The outcome nav_tick() shows with that very tick stays for NAV_IDLE_MS unless somebody acts - and
 *   so does any other screen the user went to while the request ran.
 * - The idle time of the backlight starts anew: a screen that is dark by the standby rule lights up, for the
 *   standby time where there is nothing to show. Not while the heat keeps the screen dark (the level is
 *   GUARD_HEAT_OFF): nothing wakes that, and the idle time of the backlight stays what the last hand left -
 *   the screen does not light up for an outcome of the past when the heat lets go either. nav is told all the
 *   same: an outcome that came in that dark is still on the screen if the light comes back within NAV_IDLE_MS.
 * - It is no input in any other sense. Nothing is confirmed, answered or acknowledged by it: the outcome and
 *   the failure stay until the user leaves them, a question of the browser and "Update in Ordnung?" wait on.
 *   The release of the web interface is not renewed (access.h: a change through the web alone does that), the
 *   hold of the clear dialog is not touched, and a press that began on a dark screen is dropped as before,
 *   also if the screen lit up for an outcome while the knob was held.
