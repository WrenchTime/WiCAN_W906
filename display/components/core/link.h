 * The WiFi side of the display: when to scan, which network to join, where the adapter is in that network,
 * and when the display opens its own access point. Pure logic: the caller drives the WiFi driver, reports
 * what happened and asks what to do next. One action is under way at a time.
 *
 * The network may be a router, the access point of the WiCAN itself, or anything else (net_select.h). The
 * adapter may sleep for days while the display is on permanent power, so looking for it must be cheap:
 * scans become rare when nothing is found.
 *
 *   no profile stored          the own access point is on, nothing is scanned
 *   profiles stored            scan -> join the first profile that is in range -> find the adapter there
 *   joined                     by the rule of the profile (net_host_rule): the stored host, the gateway, or
 *                              a query for the service _wican._tcp
