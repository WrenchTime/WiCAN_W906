/*
 * The knob of the display: turning in detents, and its press switch.
 *
 * The switch is read through an I2C port expander about every 20 ms; a reading can fail. The schematic has
 * no debounce capacitors. The switch counts as pressed or released once KNOB_DEBOUNCE readings in a row
 * that succeeded say so; a failed reading says nothing and does not count for either.
 *
 *   short press: released again before KNOB_LONG_MS            -> KNOB_SHORT at the release
 *   long press:  kept pressed for KNOB_LONG_MS                 -> KNOB_LONG once, while still pressed;
 *                                                                 the release that follows reports nothing
 *
 * A failed reading breaks no row either and reports nothing. Both times count from the reading with which the
 * switch began to count as pressed; the release is the reading with which it counts as released. KNOB_LONG
 * is reported by a reading that succeeds and reads pressed. A release at KNOB_LONG_MS or later without
 * such a reading before it (readings were missing) reports nothing: nobody saw how long the switch was held.
 *
 * The clear dialog reads the switch by its own, stricter rules (hold.h); while it is open the caller does
 * not act on the events of this module.
 *
 * The encoder is counted by the pulse counter of the chip. A detent is one click of the knob under the hand,
 * and the unit the display turns in (nav.h: one detent is one page or one row). One detent is
 * KNOB_COUNTS_PER_DETENT counts: two. That number was measured on the board on 2026-10-09, not read from a
 * data sheet: while it was 4, two detents of the hand turned one page.
 *
 * The direction. Turning clockwise, seen from the front, counts DOWN on this board. Seen on the device on
 * 2026-10-10 (firmware b1827ef, `reverse` off): clockwise made the brightness lower and moved the focus of
 * the menu up, and both were negative detents. board.c had assumed the opposite and nobody had looked. So a
 * detent clockwise is -1 from knob_turn(), and +1 with `reverse` set.
 * The owner keeps pages and rows as they are on his device: they take the sign as it comes (nav.h), and
 * `reverse` is the setting for who wants them the other way. The brightness alone has a direction of its
 * own - clockwise is brighter - and nav.h takes the setting back there.
 *
 * What is left of a detent is kept, so that slow turning loses nothing, and dropped after KNOB_REST_MS
 * without a count, so that a knob resting between two detents does not add up to a step some day. With two
 * counts a detent, what is left is one count and never more: half a detent. So the two counts of a detent
 * have to come less than KNOB_REST_MS apart; a single count that nothing follows in that time is forgotten.
