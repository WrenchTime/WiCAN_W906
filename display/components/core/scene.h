/*
 * Fills *scene. Every field is set on every call (unused texts empty, unused counts 0, unused permille -1,
 * dot -1 without dots), every byte of the struct: items, rows and lines that are not used are zero, and so
 * is what lies between the fields. Two scenes that show the same are the same memory.
 *
 * A choice is enabled exactly when a short press of the knob on it would do something: this module keeps no
 * rule of its own for that, it asks nav.h (nav_row_acts(), with the row as nav.h counts it and the world as
 * it is). So the screen never draws a row as if it worked while the press on it is ignored. The conditions
 * named with the screens below are those of nav.h, written down for the reader (can_read, can_clear, flow,
 * old_lines, previous_firmware, ap_kept and release_lasting of the world). What lies over the screen is not
 * asked: the rows below an overlay are those without it. Phase, number and reason of the own request come
 * from `flow`.
 *
 * ring: ring_state() with the view of the connection, its state, and - on a value page - the worst level
 * and `old`; level 0 and not old on every other screen.
 *   level  Only a value that is shown counts (LIVE or OLD, with a text): one that became a dash raises no
 *          level, although values.h still has its last number.
 *   old    At least one item of the page is LAYOUT_ITEM_OLD, or shows the dash for a value that went
 *          missing: one the adapter has delivered before on this connection - the display holds it,
 *          values_find() finds it - and that is gone by its age (LAYOUT_ITEM_NO_VALUE) or has a text that
 *          cannot be made. So a page in the view LIVE on which a value went missing never has the ring of
 *          "live, all well", also when all of its values have become dashes.
 *          A value that was never delivered on this connection is a dash as well, but it does not count: the
 *          vehicle does not answer every value of its profile, and such a page would keep the yellow ring
 *          for ever. The page counts as fresh if everything that was ever delivered is fresh - also a page
 *          on which nothing was delivered yet. "On this connection" is what values.h holds: since the
 *          display joined the network and since the adapter started (values_clear(), poll.h). The mark
 *          `delivered` of the catalogue is not asked: it outlasts a pause of the network.
 *          LAYOUT_ITEM_UNAVAILABLE does not count either: the profile does not provide the value, nothing is
 *          wrong.
 * On NAV_DTC_BUSY and NAV_DTC_CONFIRM the screen has an arc of its own (permille), and two arcs on one
 * screen would be read as one: the ring is never RING_PROGRESS there. Where ring_state() gives
 * RING_PROGRESS the scene carries RING_NONE with permille 0; every other ring stays, and so does the ring
 * of every other screen.
 *
 * NAV_PAGES
 *   The view of the connection decides (conn_view):
 *   LIVE, SCAN, NO_API          SCENE_VALUES of page nav->page
 *   every other view            SCENE_NOTICE, title empty, line 1 text_view(view); for ECU_OFFLINE line 2
 *                               "Bordnetz 12,4 V" if the state has a battery voltage (one decimal, comma)
 *   nav->page is -1             SCENE_NOTICE with the line "Keine Ansicht mit verfügbaren Werten"
 *   or outside the layout       (in the views LIVE, SCAN and NO_API; else the notice of the view)
 *   The battery voltage is rounded to a tenth of a volt; there is one if batt_mv is 0 or more.
 *   SCENE_VALUES: title = title of the page. Per item, by layout_item_state():
 *     LIVE         text = layout_item_text(), tone by layout_item_level(): 2 ALARM, 1 WARN, else NORMAL
 *     OLD          the same text, tone DIM
 *     NO_VALUE     text SCENE_DASH, tone DIM (whether the value went missing or never arrived: the ring
 *                  tells the two apart, see above)
 *     UNAVAILABLE  text SCENE_UNAVAILABLE, tone DIM
 *     A value whose text cannot be made (layout_item_text() false) counts as NO_VALUE.
 *     In the view SCAN the adapter delivers no values (a scan took 35 s on the vehicle, measured 2026-10-04,
 *     more than three times VALUE_KEPT_MS), and the age of a value does not count: a value the display holds
 *     (values_find() finds it) counts as OLD however long ago it was seen - its text, tone DIM, unit and
 *     permille as for every old value, and as NO_VALUE if its text cannot be made. A value the display never
 *     had is what layout_item_state() says, the dash or SCENE_UNAVAILABLE. So during a scan no value has
 *     another tone than DIM (the values stand still), and none turns into a dash because the scan lasts.
 *     What the driver sees of it:
 *       - "holds" is every value since the last values_clear() (values.h). A value that was a dash before
 *         the scan began, because the vehicle had stopped answering it, comes back with its last number for
 *         the time of the scan, dimmed like the others: the scene does not know when the scan began.
 *       - when the scan is over the rule ends at once, in every other view the age counts as before: the
 *         values are then as old as the scan took, so the page shows dashes and the yellow ring until the
 *         first answer of GET /autopid_data that renews them (values.h) is there. conn.h asks for one in the
 *         round in which the state no longer shows the scan.
 *     label = the label of the item, or fmt_label() of the key if it has none (empty if that does not fit).
 *     unit = layout_item_unit(); empty for a state widget and when the text is the dash or SCENE_UNAVAILABLE.
 *     widget as in the layout (what is no member of the enum becomes number, as layout.h shows it).
 *     permille for arc and bar with a value: (shown value - min) * 1000 / (max - min), rounded down,
 *     clamped to 0..1000; the shown value is value * scale, on = 1, off = 0. -1 without a range: min and
 *     max have to be set, min below max (layout_parse() sees to that), and the calculation must not leave
 *     the numbers of a double (limits of about 1e305 and beyond are no range).
 *   For every scene of NAV_PAGES, the notices as well:
 *   dots = pages for which layout_page_shown() holds, dot = position of nav->page among them, -1 if it is
 *   not one of them (a page that is hidden or has no value in the catalogue is still shown, until
 *   nav_tick() leaves it).
 *   note, the first that applies: "Sicherer Modus – eingebaute Ansichten" in safe mode; "Zu heiß – Anzeige
 *   gedimmt" if heat is not GUARD_HEAT_NORMAL; text_view(view) for SCAN and NO_API; else empty.
 * NAV_MENU       SCENE_LIST "Menü": "Fehlerspeicher"; "Helligkeit" detail "80 %" (world->brightness);
 *                "Nachtmodus" detail "an" / "aus"; "Web-Zugriff" detail "frei" / "gesperrt"

 *                old_lines > 0); "Zurück". note = text_block(read_block), empty if allowed.
 *                The third row and the title of NAV_DTC_OLD do not say "gelöscht": the list is kept when the
 *                adapter accepts a clear, and the adapter can still refuse that clear at its own engine check.
 *                What is kept is the list from before a clear, not always one that was cleared.
 *                One line says where things stand, by the phase of `flow`:
 *                  IDLE                  "Noch nicht gelesen"
 *                  READ_SENT, READING    "Lesen läuft …"
 *                  LIST                  "3 Fehler in 2 Steuergeräten", the line of the clear dialog (see
 *                                        there); without a summary "Liste gelesen"
 *                  CLEAR_SENT, CLEARING  "Löschen läuft …"

 *                  UNKNOWN               "Stand des Löschens unbekannt"
 *                A phase that is no member of the enum counts as IDLE, as it does for nav.h.
 * NAV_DTC_BUSY   SCENE_PROGRESS, title "Fehlerspeicher lesen" (flow READ_SENT, READING) or "Fehlerspeicher
 *                löschen" (CLEAR_SENT, CLEARING); in every other phase title "Fehlerspeicher", big "…",
 *                permille 0 and no line (nothing is under way; nav_tick() leaves the screen).
 *                If the state of the adapter shows the own request (dtc.seq equals flow->seq, flow in READING
 *                or CLEARING) running, or done with the result still on its way: big "5/18" (dtc.step "/"
 *                dtc.total), line 1 the short name of the control unit (dtc_short_name of dtc.name, empty if
 *                the state names none), or "Prüfe Motor …" at step 0; permille = step * 1000 / total (0 if
 *                total is 0, at most 1000). Otherwise big "…", line 1 "Auftrag gesendet", permille 0. The
 *                last line is then always "ca. 35 s – Live-Werte pausieren".
 *                A read that waits for an adapter that is out of sight (flow READ_SENT or READING while the
 *                view of the connection is NO_WIFI, CONNECTING or NO_ANSWER; dtc_flow.h) shows none of that:
 *                big "…", permille 0, line 1 "Verbindung unterbrochen", line 2 "Warte auf WiCAN", and no
 *                third line - the same two lines in both phases. The second line says what the display does
 *                and nothing of the adapter, of which it knows nothing during the pause: an adapter that
 *                accepted the read may scan on, may hold the result of a scan that is done, may be asleep or
 *                switched off, and of a read whose POST got no answer nobody knows whether it arrived. The
 *                state the connection may still hold is from before the pause: its step is not shown, and
 *                "ca. 35 s" would promise an end. A clear is shown as above in every view: it does not wait
 *                (its outcome is unknown as soon as the adapter is out of reach, and nav_tick() leaves the
 *                screen).
 *                The ring is that of the view, as on every screen: red without a network and without an

 *                (world->flow is READ_SENT, READING, CLEAR_SENT or CLEARING): nav.h ignores a press on them
 *                then, a restart would cut the request off. "Hotspot" is not enabled while the own access
 *                point stays on whatever is asked (world->ap_kept: safe mode, or no stored network): nav.h
 *                ignores the press, which would switch nothing. Its detail is that of ap_on all the same, and
 *                neither safe_mode of this input nor ap_on decides whether the row is enabled.
 * NAV_CONFIRM    SCENE_CHOICE, by nav->confirm: NAV_DO_REBOOT "Neu starten?"; NAV_DO_PREVIOUS_FIRMWARE
 *                "Vorherige Version starten?"; NAV_DO_FACTORY_RESET "Werkseinstellungen?" with the lines

 *                Any other value of nav->confirm: no title, no line.
 * A screen that is no member of nav_screen_t: SCENE_NOTICE without any text.
 *
 * Lists: the lines of a fault memory list become rows by their kind: HEAD -> SCENE_ROW_HEAD, CODE ->
 * SCENE_ROW_SUB, everything else SCENE_ROW_LINE, with text and detail of the line; the choices are
 * SCENE_ROW_ACTION. total = all rows of the screen (nav_rows()). Visible are at most SCENE_ROWS_MAX rows
 * with the focused row (nav->row) in the middle where that is possible: first = nav->row - 2, kept within
 * 0 and total - SCENE_ROWS_MAX (0 if total is smaller). A focus that lies on no row (a list became shorter
 * and nav_tick() has not run yet) leaves every row without it. A line pointer that is NULL counts as no
 * lines even if the world names some: the rows are then the choices alone, and total counts only them.
 *
 * Overlay (nav_overlay()):
 *   UPLOAD   "Firmware wird übertragen", "42 %" (upload_percent, kept within 0..100); over_permille = ten
 *            times that
 *   ASK      line 1 by the question (world->asking): WIFI "WLAN speichern?", FIRMWARE "Firmware
 *            installieren?", RESET "Werkseinstellungen?", empty for any other value; line 2 ask_detail if
 *            there is one (not NULL, not empty); then "Drücken = ja · lang = nein (42 s)" with
 *            access_ask_seconds_left()
 *   UPDATE   "Update in Ordnung?", "Knopf drücken", "sonst alte Version in 4:12" (update_left_s as
 *            minutes:seconds). No word of a touch: the knob alone answers (nav.h)
 * The screen below is filled as without the overlay.
